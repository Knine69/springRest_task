Error cases tested in tests classes -> AssertThrows:
                                        Are they always/sometimes necessary considering spring boot has required fields?
Utilities in test classes -> Mock uses: Are they being used in a correct manner? Is it too "happy path"?

Relevant classes/tests to use in different environment profiles -> Not common
Patching methods -> More versatile/easy to use methods compared to implemented solution
Javadoc's placement -> Should be used in Controllers(Endpoints)/business logic?
Relevant directories/files to push to repository -> What shouldn't be pushed to repository
